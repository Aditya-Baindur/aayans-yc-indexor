# Aayan's-YC-indexor

Describe a YC startup in any words you like and the logos that match float up out of a physics pile, each with how likely it is.
All 6,241 companies are searchable by what they do, what their logo looks like, and what they say inside it.

## Cloudflare Workers edition

This fork includes a separate Workers build in `cloudflare/`. It keeps the physics pile and the 6,241-company catalog, while replacing the Mac-only server process with a Worker and static assets. It uses Cloudflare Workers AI's BGE Small text embeddings, the committed company vectors, name/tag/description matching, logo colors, and OCR text. Jev judges the shortlisted candidates through Vercel AI Gateway when `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is configured as a Worker secret; its answers supply the displayed percentages. If Vercel's TypeSafe route returns a service failure, the Worker tries Vercel's evaluation API. If the gateway still fails, the Worker tries Jev through its Cloudflare AI binding, which may incur Cloudflare AI charges. Authentication errors still show as gateway errors so a bad key can be fixed. Without the key, the app labels the percentages as estimated relevance. Click a floating result logo to open the company website in a new tab. It does **not** reproduce MobileCLIP's visual-semantic search. Image uploads and MacBook motion are disabled; the catalog is built from the committed data.

With Node 20.9+ and a Cloudflare account connected to Wrangler:

```bash
npm install --ignore-scripts
npm run cf:deploy
```

`--ignore-scripts` avoids downloading the original macOS app's native ONNX runtime during installation. Wrangler will prompt you to log in if needed. To enable Jev, run `npx wrangler secret put AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY --config cloudflare/wrangler.jsonc` and enter your Vercel AI Gateway key at the private prompt. Never put the key in the repo. The Workers AI binding is configured in `cloudflare/wrangler.jsonc`; no Apple Silicon machine is needed. For local development, use `npm run cf:dev`; Workers AI inference may require Wrangler's remote mode. The Worker search assets are generated from `data/` and `public/` by `npm run cf:build` and are not committed.

## You need an Apple Silicon Mac

This is a hard requirement, not a preference. Every search embeds your query with MobileCLIP-S0, and that model is Core ML,
which only exists on Apple platforms. `native/coreml_embed` is a compiled arm64 binary that loads it and every search goes
through it. On Linux or Windows the first query throws.

The rest of the stack is portable, so this is fixable if you want it. The same MobileCLIP checkpoint has an ONNX export that
matches Core ML to a cosine of 0.999914, and `onnxruntime-node` is already a dependency. `NOTES.md` has the measurements.

You also need Node 20 or newer, and a TypeSafe key.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aayan-DEV/aayans-yc-indexor && cd aayans-yc-indexor
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## The key

Put a TypeSafe key in `.env.local` as `TYPE_SAFE_KEY`. Get one at [typesafe.ai](https://typesafe.ai).

`.env.local` is gitignored and is not in this repo, which is the point: it holds your real key. `.env.example` is the
template you copy. If this sits next to sibling projects that share one key file, a `.env` one directory up is read as a
fallback.

Without a key the app still starts and the pile still works, but Jev never gets asked and ranking falls back to a local
scorer. You can see it in the API response: `degraded: true` and `costUsd: null`. Results get noticeably worse.

First start takes about sixteen seconds while the sentence model loads. After that a search is roughly one second and
costs about a fifth of a cent.

## Optional: tilt the laptop

```bash
npm run build:motion
```

That compiles a helper which reads the MacBook's accelerometer and lid angle straight off the HID devices and streams them
to the page, so tilting the laptop tilts gravity in the pile and shaking it throws the icons. macOS gives browsers no
motion events, so there is no other way to get at it. Without the helper nothing changes and the pile keeps ordinary gravity.

If either Swift binary refuses to run on your macOS version, rebuild it with `npm run build:native` or `npm run build:motion`.

## How it finds things

Retrieval is ordinary vector maths over all 6,241 companies, four signals at once:

- **meaning**, bge-small sentence embeddings of each company's write-up
- **looks**, MobileCLIP-S0 image vectors of the logo itself
- **letters**, what Apple's Vision OCR read inside the logo
- **tags**, YC's own 337 tags, re-applied to every company by Jev because YC's own tagging is patchy

That narrows 6,241 down to at most 320 finalists. Jev then scores every finalist in one parallel request and returns a
calibrated probability rather than generated text, which is why the percentages on screen are real and why it lands in
about a second.

## Adding companies

Everything the app reads is committed, so you never need this to run it. `tools/yc-data/` has the scripts that built
`data/companies.json` and `public/icons/` in the first place, with a README giving the order to run them in.

## Everything else

`NOTES.md` is the long version: the retrieval pipeline in detail, the physics and frame-pacing work, the sprite atlas, and
the measurements behind all of it.
